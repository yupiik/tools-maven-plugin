[abstract]
Setting up dev environment can be a nightmare.
_yem_ intends to make it easier.

== Inspiration

_yem_ is inspired from SDKMan, Chocolatey and other alternatives.
The main differences are:

* _yem_ does not come with a remote storage but it tries to reuse existing ones - priviledging immutable one when possible (compared to SDKMan where you can loose the version you picked),
* _yem_ intends to be portable (linux/windows at least),
* _yem_ is extensible if needed (new source or tool/distribution).

== Configuration

IMPORTANT: the atomic configuration is listed there but used on the command line you must ensure to prefix any option by `-` and replace dots by `-`. Example: `central.base` becomes `--central-base`.

include::{partialsdir}/generated/documentation.yem.adoc[lines=4..-1]

== CLI

The command line uses spaces between option and value: `yem install --tool java --version 21.0.2`.

=== Commands

include::{partialsdir}/generated/commands.yem.adoc[]

== Auto-path

A bit like SDKMan, _yem_ supports to initialize an environment from a file but with some differences.

The file must be a `properties` file.
Each tool/distribution setup has several properties:

[source,properties]
----
prefix.version = 1.2.3 <1>
prefix.provider = xxxx <2>
prefix.relaxed = [true|false] <3>
prefix.envVarName = xxxx <4>
prefix.addToPath = [true|false] <5>
prefix.failOnMissing = [true|false] <6>
prefix.installIfMissing = [true|false] <7>
prefix.toolName = 1.2.3 <8>
----
<.> Version of the tool to install, using `relaxed` option it can be a version prefix (`21.` for ex),
<.> Provider to use to resolve the tool, if you want to force `zulu` provider instead of using SDKMan to install Java versions for example,
<.> Should version be matched exactly or the first matching one be used,
<.> When `addToPath` is `true` (default) the environment name to setup for this tool - deduced from tool name otherwise, generally `uppercase(tool)_HOME` with dot replaced by underscores,
<.> Should the `PATH` be set too - note that when it is the case `YEM_ORIGINAL_PATH` is set too allowing to reset `PATH` when exiting the folder,
<.> Should the execution fail if a tool is missing (mainly for debug purposes),
<.> Should tools be installed automatically when missing - CI friendly,
<.> If your prefix does not match the tool name, the tool name to use.

Only the `version` property is required of `prefix` matches a tool name.
You can get as much group of properties as needed tools (one for java 11, one for java 17, one for maven 4 etc...).
