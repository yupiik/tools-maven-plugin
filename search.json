Here is the list of available attributes you can use:\n:minisite-blog-published-date: yyyy-MM-dd: when the page will be rendered (if not set it is always rendered).\n:minisite-blog-categories: c1,c2: comma separated list of categories of this post\n:minisite-blog-authors: My, Myself: comma separated list of author names\n:minisite-blog-summary: Some short description.: the summary of this post used on post list pages.\nBlog page example:\nPre actions enables to generate some content from the project. It is typically used to generate configuration from code or things like that. It uses the documentation module classpath. Actions must implement Runnable and can have some (public) constructor parameters (we use parameter names to match so ensure to enable -parameters in maven compiler plugin):\nconfiguration (Map<String, String>): the action configuration, it enables to reuse it if needed or write generic actions\nsourceBase (Path): the base directory you can generate .adoc into (generally where you sources are, tip: use generated folder to be able to exclude it in .gitignore if desired)\noutputBase (Path): the base directory you can generate direct html assets\nUsing type=maven-plugin (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.maven.service.action.builtin.MojoDocumentationGeneration you can get a plugin.xml file parsed to generate:\nOne file per goal with some usage, the goal description and parameters (named <goal>.adoc)\nOne file listing all goals (named <goal-prefix>-maven-plugin.adoc)\nThe configuration of this action is:\npluginXml: file path or resource to find the plugin.xml file.\ntoBase: where to generate the adoc.\ndescription: a global plugin description for the \"listing\" page (default is empty and page will just list goals).\nUsing type=copy (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.maven.service.action.builtin.CopyFile will copy a file from a source to a destination: It is typically useful for assets (openapi.json for example).\nfrom: source file.\nto: destination.\nUsing type=jsonschema (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.maven.service.action.builtin.JsonSchemaGenerator will generate a JSON-Schema from a class:\nclass: the class to generate the schema from.\nto: destination of the schema.\ntype: JSON for a raw JSON-Schema (default) or ADOC for a textual, asciidoctor output.\nsetClassAsTitle: true to force object title to be the class name.\nuseReflectionForDefaults: true to force reflection to try to extract defaults of attributes.\npretty when type=JSON, should the JSON be prettified or not (default=true).\nlevelPrefix when type=ADOC, a title prefix (== for example), = by default.\ntitle and description enable to set class title/description for its json schema. It is required for type=ADOC.\nannotationOnlyProvidesTheDescription enable to never take the title from an annotation (@Description(value) case).\nthe model classes can use a custom @Description(title,description) annotation (note that @Doc is also supported and value method can be used instead of description). See JsonDocExtractor for more details.\nUsing type=jsonschema2adoc (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.maven.service.action.builtin.JsonSchema2AdocGenerator will generate an asciidoctor document from a JSON-Schema file (intended to be used with fusion mainly):\nschema: location of the schema (JSON).\nroot: key under schemas map of the root schema to generate a doc for.\nlevelPrefix: prefix to set for title (default =).\noutput: where to generate the .adoc.\nUsing type=openmetrics2adoc (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.tools.minisite.action.builtin.OpenMetricsToAsciidoc will generate an asciidoctor form from an OpenMetrics export.\nsource: path of the openmetrics dump.\nto: destination of the asciidoc generated from source.\nlevelPrefix: a prefix set before the part title (`== ` by default for a second level title).\nlegend: should tables have a legend (name of the metric), default to true.\nheader: prefix the whole rendering (enables to set a title and some options if needed).\nUsing type=simple-configuration (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.tools.minisite.action.builtin.SimpleConfigurationGenerator will generate an asciidoctor from a configuration class passed in class <configuration> option.\nclass: root configuration fully qualified name.\noutput: where to generate the .adoc to.\nUsing type=download-unzip (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.tools.minisite.action.builtin.DownloadAndUnzip enables to download a zip from a HTTP url then extract it totally or partially to a particular folder. This can be used to download a git repository using Github/Gitlab/Gitea API for example.\nurl: the zip URL.\nsubpath: the subpath to copy in target. It filters the zip entries names by prefix.\nheaders: in properties format, a set of headers to set.\ntarget: where to copy the selected files.\nworkdir: temporary folder (to download the zip), temporary if not set.\nUsing type=replace-in-file (recommended) or type=io.yupiik.tools.minisite.action.builtin.ReplaceInFile will rewrite a text file replacing a string by another one.\nsource: file to rewrite.\ntoken: text to replace.\nreplacement: text replacing token.\nusing regex{xxx} as token will use a java regex to do the replacement.\nSome specific attributes enables to customize the generation. Here is their list:\nminisite-skip=[true|false] enables to skip a .adoc rendering even if not in _partials directory.\nminisite-path=<string> enables to force the relative path of the file, for example a file name foo-bar.adoc with the attribute minisite-path set to foo/bar.html will output a foo/bar.html file instead of foo-bar.html. Note however it does not rewrite the links to ensure to use …..html instead of ref to link this page then.\nminisite-highlightjs-skip enables to not setup highlight.js for the page (useful with swagger-ui for example).\nTo include a page in the index it must contain minisite-index attribute. Its value is the order of the entry in the index tiles.\nensure to not use 1, 2, 3, … but rather 100, 200, … to easily insert an item later.\nminisite-index-title attribute enables to override link text.\nminisite-index-icon attribute enables to override font awesome icon (without fa- prefix).\nminisite-index-description attribute enables to override the text in the index tile for the page entry.\nWhen you write some documentation in a language close to the minisite interpolation one (mustache for ex), it can be hard to use. To ease that, you can surround your snippet with and , included text will not support interpolations.\nThen run mvn yupiik-tools:synchronize-github-releases.\nscript-cli-skeleton enables to generates a skeleton layout to write a CLI in bash (helper commands for your project).\ncan be used on a pomless project: mvn io.yupiik.maven:yupiik-tools-maven-plugin:<version>:script-cli-skeleton -Dyupiik.script-cli-skeleton.directory=/path/to/script-project (version >= 1.0.26).\nTo add a command:\nCreate an index.sh containing the command script in commands folder\n(optional) create a commands/<your command name>/_cli/help.txt file containing the help description.\nThe project adds asciidoc macros to get back some maven build information. Note that it must be executed in the right lifecycle phase if using some project metadata (plugin does not require any resolution to be usable standalone).\nEnables to list the project dependencies.\nScope can be:\ncompile\nruntime\ncompile+runtime\nruntime+system\ntest\nprovided_only\ncompile_only\ntest_only\nsystem_only\nruntime_only\nThe optional attribute groupId is also supported and take a list (comma separated) of groupId to include.\nsimple-dependencies is a trivial and simple alternative to maven-dependency-plugin:list mojo which outputs the data in JSON.\nIt is convenient with minisite mojo to format with a custom action the dependencies according to a custom need.\nThis extension sets up the equivalent of a parent pom but enables to inherit or not from another parent and to benefit from upgrades for free.\nIt is configured in the root project through maven properties:\nJust enabling this extension will upgrade a few plugin, enforce the encoding and java version, enforce license check and much more.\nSee io.yupiik.maven.extension.YupiikOSSExtension.afterProjectsRead for details.\nIt enables to put in each module a YupiikContributor.java file which will be compiled and executed in afterProjectRead(MavenSession) callback.\nExample:\nThis enables to programmatically handle the pom (mainly intended for plugins since dependencies are not synchronized in maven poms when contributed this way).\nTo enable it, enable the related extension:\nsee io.yupiik.maven.extension.YupiikOSSExtension for a more complex participant example.\nCrypt mojos are intended to encrypt/decrypt (using AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding algorithm - like maven default encryption) values. It supports either inline values or properties files.\nit is a neat way to handle secrets in a bundlebee placeholder properties file on CI/CD if you don’t have a vault or equivalent mecanism for GitOps.\nyupiik-tools:crypt-value will enable to encrypt a value (symmetrically, decrypt-value will decrypt a value).\nConfiguration is:\nvalue: the value to crypt (decrypt),\nuseStdout: should the value be printed using Maven logger or simply stdout,\nmasterPassword: the master password for the ciphering.\ninput: path to the properties file to crypt (decrypt) values for (keys are never encrypted),\noutput: path to the properties file which will contain encrypted (decrypted) data,\nmasterPassword: the master password for the ciphering,\nincludedKeys: a list of values (direct key), start:<some prefix> prefixes or regex:<pattern> regex to filter the values to encrypt (decrypt) based on their keys,\nexcludedKeys: a list of values (direct key), start:<some prefix> prefixes or regex:<pattern> regex to filter the values to NOT encrypt (decrypt) based on their keys.\noutput always sorts the keys and will ignore comments. An already encoded value will not be re-encoded.
